# Crafting Smarter Mixins with Extend

### Mixins and extends are essential features for any Sass developer. Anthony DiSpezio shows how to leverage them at the same time to write smarter Sass and cleaner CSS.

Sass, the leading preprocessor for CSS, has a well-earned reputation among front-end developers for wrangling complex CSS into smart, reusable code. This is unquestionably valuable for scaling and maintainability, and allows front-end developers to augment the shortcomings presented by traditional CSS. Of its versatile toolkit, two of Sass’ most fundamental features are mixins and extends. While often grouped together for their ability to generate additional styles, each offers a unique approach for solving common CSS drawbacks.

In developing Sass proficiency, knowing when to use a mixin or extend is key. But mixins and extends are by no means exclusive and, when used together, can produce cleaner, more robust markup. To better understand how these two features can work in tandem, let’s start by taking a closer look at their unique behavior.

## The Humble Mixin
Mixins are one of the basic building blocks of Sass. Simply wrap a group of properties or selectors in a mixin and the code can be reused by including the mixin later on. Writing the commonly shared code once ensures that future edits can be made in a single place -- a core tenant of the DRY (don’t repeat yourself) methodology. This example button mixin contains shared border properties that are included by two different button classes.

```scss
@mixin button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
}

.search-button {
    @include button;
    background-color: blue;
}

.cancel-button {
    @include button;
    background-color: red;
}
```
```css
/* CSS Output */
.search-button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
    background-color: blue;
}

.cancel-button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
    background-color: red;
}
```

*A mixins contents is included every time it's called. In our example, the border properties are repeated in both classes.*

This is already a huge improvement over plain CSS and we’ve only just scratched the surface. Mixins also accept inputs, called arguments, which can be used as variables for properties or even class names. Let’s look at a more advanced example that generates entire button classes with a unique class name and background color:
```scss
@mixin button($name, $background-color) {
    .#{$name}-button {
        background-color: $background-color;
        border-radius: 4px;
        border: 4px solid black;
    }
}
```

Include the mixin with the values for each argument to generate unique CSS for each class:
```scss
@include button('search', blue);
@include button('cancel', red);
```
```css
/* CSS Output */
.search-button {
    background-color: blue;
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
}

.cancel-button {
    background-color: red;
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
}
```

Even in this small example it’s easy to see the scalable power of Sass!

## Downsides of Duplication
The ability for mixins to repeat blocks of CSS is straightforward, but not always smart. The CSS output generated by the mixin now contains two classes, each with identical border properties. Constantly using mixins in this manner will generate less-than-optimal markup and a bloated CSS output full of duplicate code. Luckily, extend is able to pick up where the mixin leaves off. 

## DRYing Out with Extend
Extend allows classes to inherit all of the properties of another class by grouping the selectors together. Instead of duplicating the CSS each time like a mixin, the selector is grouped with the class it extended:

```scss
.button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
}

.search-button {
    @extend .button;
    background: blue;
}
```
```css
/* CSS Output */
.button,
.search-button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
}

.search-button {
    background: blue;
}
```

Now our output only has one instance of the border properties shared by our buttons. We can utilize this convention to make the output of the mixin more streamlined.

![@extend visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adispezio/learn/master/crafting-smarter-mixins-with-extend/image3.png)
*Instead of writing duplicate code with a mixin, the extended properties are grouped together to lessen the redundancy.*

## So Happy Together
The mixin-only approach was bloated because, every time we called the mixin, we unnecessarily duplicated the border properties. Instead of writing these shared properties directly in the mixin, we can extend an existing class that contains them, reducing the amount of duplicate code:

```scss
.button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black;
}

@mixin button($name, $background-color) {
    .#{$name}-button {
        background-color: $background-color;
        @extend .button;
    }
}

@include button('search', blue);
@include button('cancel', red);
```

The classes that inherit the shared button properties have been grouped with the `.button` class, eliminating the duplicate border properties.

```css
/* CSS Output */
.buton, .search-button, .cancel-button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 4px solid black; 
}

.search-button {
    background-color: blue; 
}

.cancel-button {
    background-color: red;
}
```

This mixin/extend combo can be used to generate many buttons while reducing the amount of duplicate CSS. More advanced Sass features, like placeholder selectors, can further increase the cleanliness of this code.

## Finding a Balance
Intelligent use of mixins and extends has lead to some remarkable Sass modules, but remember to always check the CSS output. Sass is not a panacea for every CSS issue and will require some finesse to achieve the expected output. Experiment with different techniques and see how these features can be woven together to create powerful mixins and clean stylesheets. Sass’ active community means there are always new ideas to explore, discover and contribute. Have fun!

# ‘Clever’ is Not Always Better
Sass offers endless possibilities for streamlining and refactoring CSS. It’s tempting to use every Sass feature in a project and it’s not uncommon for new developers to take things a little too far. Always remember the goal is to increase productivity while simultaneously maintaining clean CSS output. If a mixin or extend is so complicated that it’s hard to maintain, it’s probably been over-engineered. If you find yourself in this position, take a step back and don’t be afraid to simplify.

Sometimes over-engineering can lead to functional problems as well. Abuse of Sass directives can break the cascade or cause specificity issues. Chaining extends across multiple files can lead to unexpected selector output and bloated mixins inside loops can create massive amounts of excess CSS. Always keep your Sass and CSS output manageable and respect the basic principles of CSS.

Keeping Sass manageable is not an excuse to write bad CSS. It is always good practice to write efficient CSS selectors (even if performance gains are marginal), but there’s no need to over-complicate your Sass modules to the point where you don’t understand how they work. An easy-to-understand mixin that produces a few extra lines of CSS may prove to be more valuable in the long run, especially when working in large teams.

Sass guru Hugo Giraudel said it best in his article *Keep Sass Simple*: “Everything is not meant to be used everywhere.” This sentiment rings true for many of the esoteric uses for Sass. They might be great experiments, but often introduce far too much complexity into production-ready projects.
